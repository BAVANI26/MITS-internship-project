This project is a simple graphical calculator application built using Python's `tkinter` library. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a user-friendly interface.

💡 Features

- Intuitive GUI with clickable buttons
- Supports basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Includes a clear button to reset input
- Handles input errors gracefully (e.g., divide by zero)
- Built using only the standard Python library (`tkinter`)

🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter (pre-installed with Python on most systems)
